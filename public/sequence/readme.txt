Place your sequence images in this folder.
You should name them frame-1.jpg, frame-2.jpg, etc., up to frame-50.jpg for this example.

If you don't have a pre-made sequence, you can:
1. Use a video and extract frames using a tool like FFmpeg
2. Generate frames using AI tools
3. Use placeholder images initially and replace them with your actual sequence later

For optimal performance:
- Keep image sizes reasonable (1920x1080 or smaller)
- Use jpg format for better loading performance
- Try to keep individual file sizes under 200KB
